- name: Nirvana - Breed
  lyrics: |
    I don't care [x5]
    Care if I'm old
    I don't mind [x5]
    Mind, don't have a mind
    Get away [x4]
    Away, away from your home
    I'm afraid [x5]
    Afraid, afraid of a ghost
    
    [chorus]
    Even if you have
    Even if you need
    I don't mean to stare
    We don't have to breed
    We could plant a house
    We could build a tree
    I don't even care
    We could have all three
    
    She said [x8]
    
    I don't care [x5]
    Care if I'm old
    I don't mind [x5]
    Mind, I don't have a mind
    Get away [x4]
    Away, away from your home
    I'm afraid [x4]
    Afraid, afraid of a ghost
    
    [to chorus]
    She said [x8]
    [to chorus]
    
    She said [x8]
    She said .. good!
