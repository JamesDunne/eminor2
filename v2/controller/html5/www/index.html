        <p>The e-minor v2 is an open-source and open-hardware project describing a custom programmable floorboard controller designed to send MIDI commands to musical instrument devices with a focus on controlling guitar amplifier and effects equipment.</p>
        <p>This project is intended to serve as a working template to help you create your own custom MIDI controller. The example controller logic is developed for use with my own personal guitar rig and its MIDI-enabled equipment.</p>

        <p>The device is a 20" by 6" sloped console chassis sporting 2 rows of 8 evenly horizontally-spaced rugged foot-switches, each paired with an indicator LED.</p>
        <p>At the back of the device is a MIDI OUT port, a USB-B port, a power switch, and a 9V DV jack.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>At this time, the prototype device is not yet assembled so there are no pictures of it to show. See the <a href="#assembly">assembly section</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2 id="my-guitar-rig">My Guitar Rig</h2>
        <p>
            My guitar rig consists of a <a href="//www.mesaboogie.com/Product_Info/Mark_Series/mark5/mark5.html" target="_blank">MESA/Boogie&trade; Mark V</a> amplifier head, an
            <a href="//www.rjmmusic.com/miniampgizmo.php" target="_blank">RJM Mini Amp Gizmo</a>, and a <a href="//www.tcelectronic.com/g-major/" target="_blank">t.c. electronics g-major</a>
            rack effects unit. Since the Mark V itself is not MIDI-enabled, I use the Mini Amp Gizmo to translate MIDI commands into more primitive on/off signals sent to the Mark V head
            via its floorboard jack. Essentially, the Mini Amp Gizmo is acting as a floorboard controller for the Mark V but is MIDI controlled.
            The g-major is also MIDI controllable and can switch presets or enable/disable certain effects depending on the MIDI commands sent to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The example controller logic is designed to send program change messages to both devices listening on separate channels (g-major on channel 1, RJM on channel 2). This way the two devices don't get confused listening to each others' commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe most things can best be explained by example, so feel free to play with the live HTML5 example below to get a feel for the controller logic. Use keyboard keys or your mouse to depress the foot-switches. The MIDI OUT window shows what
            MIDI commands would be sent.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

        <p>The NEXT/PREV foot-switches change the g-major program. For me, the g-major programs represent per-song effects settings but you are free to implement your own programming scheme.</p>
        <p>The MUTE foot-switch toggles the g-major input mute, useful for entering a silent tuning mode while on stage. The g-major still receives signal from the amplifier but mutes the output so you can still use its on-board tuner.</p>
        <p>The TAP foot-switch sends the g-major a TAP TEMPO function, useful for keeping time-related effects in sync with the song's tempo. The MIDI controller change command alternates the value used (00 and 7F) for each tap.</p>

        <p>
            The top row of foot-switches enables/disables effects on the g-major. The bottom row of foot-switches changes amplifier channels on the Mark V via the RJM. Since the Mark V is a 3-channel amplifier, having 6 channel
            foot-switches would seem strange, but the Mark V also has a built-in SOLO mode for an extra volume boost. This is why there are 6 channel foot-switches for a 3-channel amplifier: to have a both non-soloed and a soloed
            version of each channel, each available at the tap of a single foot-switch as opposed to the more cumbersome 3-channel foot-switch layout with an additional SOLO enable/disable foot-switch. Furthermore, we can treat
            these 6 foot-switches as now representing pseudo channels so that each can have its own independent configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each channel foot-switch has an associated effects on/off state for the current g-major program. This state is stored in persistent memory (i.e. program flash on the PIC18, localStorage in HTML5, and a flash.bin file
            in Windows). Experiment with the channels above and watch how your effects state is preserved with the channel. This state is temporarily stored in RAM until the program is changed or the state is persisted by request.
            To persist the state, hold down the TAP/STORE foot-switch for more than 600ms and it will be written to persistent storage. This allows for quick reprogramming on-stage, if necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            Holding down an effect control foot-switch for longer than 300ms will temporarily toggle the effect. Once released, the effect would toggle back to its original state instead of waiting for
            another tap. This would help for quick passages that need effects only for a short time, e.g. quick melodic runs with a pitch shifting effect to create harmonies.
        </p>

        <h2 id="firmware">Firmware</h2>
        <p>
            The primary controller logic for the project is written in entirely portable ISO C99 (C) code (<a href="//github.com/JamesDunne/eminor2/blob/master/v2/controller/common/controller-simple.c" target="_blank">common/controller-simple.c</a>).
            The controller logic expects a hardware interface layer consisting of several functions to be implemented in the host. Here's the C header file (abridged) for the hardware interface
            (<a href="//github.com/JamesDunne/eminor2/blob/master/v2/controller/common/hardware.h" target="_blank">common/hardware.h</a>) that the host must implement:
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre class="code-block">
<code data-language="c">// Foot switch and LED on/off states are represented with u16 bit-fields;
// The bottom row takes up LSBs (bits 0-7) and the top row takes up MSBs (bits 8-15).

extern u16 fsw_poll(void);
// Explicitly set the state of all 16 LEDs

extern void midi_send_cmd1(u8 cmd, u8 channel, u8 data1);
extern void midi_send_cmd2(u8 cmd, u8 channel, u8 data1, u8 data2);

// --------------- Flash memory functions:

// Flash addresses are 0-based where 0 is the first available byte of

// Stores `count` bytes from `data` into flash memory at address `addr`:
extern void flash_store(u16 addr, u16 count, u8 *data);</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>The controller implements three functions exported to the host:</p>
        <p>
            <pre class="code-block">
<code data-language="c">// Run once on boot to initialize controller:
void controller_init(void);

// Run every 10msec to process controller timers:
void controller_10msec_timer(void);

// Run main event loop to handle logic and update state:
void controller_handle(void);</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            As of now, there are three hosts implemented for the portable controller logic written in C:
            <ul>
                <li>This <a href="/demo.html" target="_blank">HTML5 javascript demo</a> compiled from the C code using <a href="//github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki" target="_blank">Emscripten</a></li>
                <li>A <a href="//github.com/JamesDunne/eminor2/tree/master/v2/controller/Win32" target="_blank">Windows desktop application</a> test harness (see the readme.txt) which actually sends MIDI messages for testing</li>
                <li>PIC18 microcontroller firmware controlled by physical foot-switches</li>
            </ul>
            How's that for cross-platform portability?
        </p>

        <h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
        <p>The project is designed to run on a PIC18, an 8-bit microprocessor. The TX pin (from the UART of the PIC18) is used to send MIDI data via the MIDI OUT port. The PIC18 also natively supports USB and our firmware allows one to easily reprogram the PIC via USB.</p>
        <p>We have a total of 16 inputs (foot-switches) and 16 outputs (LEDs) which are all binary in nature, on or off.</p>
        <p>To capture the foot-switch inputs, we use a pair of analog multiplexers (CD74HC4051E). Each mux can handle only 8 signals (pins A0-7) and uses 3 address lines (S0-S2) to select which signal pin to connect through to the A pin. The E' pin is used as a "fake" 4th address selector pin so we can choose which mux to read from (using a transistor). Reading of the foot-switch states is done in a tight loop (16 iterations) where the address lines are set incrementally and the BTN_IN bit is read and shifted into a bitfield and stored for later use by the portable controller logic.</p>
        <p>LED outputs are handled by a pair of shift registers (TPIC6B596N) daisy-chained together via their DO/DI pins. Each shift reg has 8 output pins. The latch pin is set low to allow the shift registers to buffer their data in and then once the latch is set high all the output pins instantaneously change. We send the shift registers data in a tight loop, strobing the SCK pin to push the bits through in MSB to LSB order.</p>

        <p>We used CADSoft Eagle to design the schematic and PCB. You can find all the project files <a href="//github.com/JamesDunne/eminor2/tree/master/v2/pcb" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here is a screenshot of the schematic:</p>

        </div>
        <p>I took the liberty of designing a PCB layout for the schematic as well. Unfortunately, due to PCB size constraints, some pin-mapping sins had to be committed so that the traces and ICs could all fit happily on the board. Look at the pin headers for the BTN_* connectors in the schematic to see what I mean. This remapping can be easily accommodated for in the physical wiring or in the firmware, whichever you find easiest to do.
        Of course, you are free to update the schematic and PCB layout to correct these things if you can find a better way.</p>

            The foot-switches we use come from <a href="//www.bitcheslovemyswitches.com/#!/%7E/product/category=5027572&id=10220659" target="_blank">bitcheslovemyswitches.com</a>. They feel great and have very little noise, no louder than a cheap pen's click.

        <p>The chassis we use is <a href="//www.hammondmfg.com/dwg16.htm#15degree" target="_blank">Hammond Mfg.'s 1456WH3BKBU</a>, an aluminum sloped console with a usable surface area of 20.078" x 6.305" on the sloped face, perfect for a floorboard controller. On their datasheet they claim they can do factory modifications (drilling, milling, printing), however one must order at least 25 units to qualify for this custom work.</p>
        <p>Our schematic does a good job of labelling all the values for the resistors and capacitors so there should be no problem there. Capacitors want to be in the 16V-25V tolerance range.</p>

        <p>I did some more testing after I made that last video and wired up a foot switch for testing purposes but I didn't capture any video for it.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>2013-12-13:</strong> I did a lot of work to get the LCD screen up and running with a bit-banged software RS232 UART. I can't use the on-board UART because that's in use by the MIDI already.</p>
        <p>This was all quite a challenge because this LCD unit was given to me by my brother and he had set its baud rate to 115.2k instead of the default 9600 for his project. Let me just say that it's very difficult
        to get a 32MHz PIC to reliably transmit at 115.2k with a bit-banged RS232 implementation but I managed to eek out 6 bytes reliably, which is thankfully more than enough to issue the "change baud rate" command to
        the LCD.</p>
        <p>After that hurdle was cleared, I had to practically rewrite my RS232 code for the 9600 baud rate since the 115.2k code was all quite a big ugly hack that was needed to just get the job done.</p>
        <p>My first goal was to get a blocking version of the bit-banged RS232 working and reliably transmitting bytes to the LCD. I used the PIC's built-in TIMER1 to handle the precision timing required for RS232. The timer
        works by incrementing a 16-bit register starting from some user-specified starting value up to 0xFFFF. Once it overflows past 0xFFFF, a special timer overflow bit (<code data-language="c">PIR1bits.TMR1IF</code>) is
        set in the timer control register. Having that bit gives one the simple ability to busy-wait the CPU on that, which is just what I did with <code data-language="c">while (PIR1bits.TMR1IF == 0);</code> in between each
        change of the TX pin to deliver the data.</p>
        <p>The PIC's TIMER1 has several configurable timing sources but for this case it's best to leave it at its default configuration: incrementing the counter with each pulse of the 32MHz instruction clock, divided by 4.
        This rate yields a timer period of 0.125 &mu;sec. All we need to do now is determine the proper countdown value to achieve 9600 baud so that we can twiddle the TX pin at that rate. Since a baud rate is just a measurement
        of the time between sending bits in the raw RS232 protocol, we can calculate that 9600 baud is 1 sec / 9600 = 104.167 &mu;sec. We can then divide that by 0.125 &mu;sec (our timer period) to find how many timer periods and we
        get 833.333. In practice, values between 832 and 834 work just fine.</p>
        <p>I encountered great difficulty in getting the bit transmission on the PIC side to synchronize with the bit receiving on the LCD side, even when I had the precise timer; it was like herding cats. The final solution
        was to set the TX pin high for a very long time on start-up (~600ms) to allow the LCD to boot up/initialize before attempting to send the first start bit (low) of the first byte. From there it was standard RS232,
        one start bit (low), 8 data bits, and one stop bit (high). Since the stop bit is high, it makes sense to "clear" the line by setting it high for an extended period of time.</p>
        <p>Since I'm new to PICs and microcontrollers in general, I was unsure of what actual clock frequency the PIC was running at. For the longest time I was operating under the simplistic assumption that the instruction
        clock cycle was 8MHz since that's the crystal's frequency. Obviously that was wrong. The PIC's datasheet was consulted. As it turns out, the instruction clock for the PIC18 is configured solely by the CPUDIV config
        bits; it has nothing to do with the specific 8MHz crystal frequency. In my project, CPUDIV is set to OSC2_PLL3 which means that the PLL (at 96MHz) is divided by 3, yielding a 32MHz instruction clock. Simple enough in
        retrospect, assuming you can decode the datasheet that is.</p>
        <p>I would love to be able to tell you that the process of getting a working LCD was as simple and scientific as that explanation above, but that would be an outright lie at this point. The real process involved much
        blood, sweat, tears, coffee, time, trial, and tons of error: just like real science! Thankfully I did learn many things about PIC timers and the RS232 protocol and I do now have a working LCD screen that is under my
        control. In retrospect, I wonder if SPI or I<sup>2</sup>C would have been easier to set up than RS232?</p>

        <p>Getting a working blocking-mode RS232 implementation was a great first goal and was cause for much celebration, aka sleep. After the celebration, the next goal was to implement a non-blocking, interrupt-based
        solution. This was much easier to do now that all the hard work had been done and proven.</p>
        <p>I configured TIMER1 to trigger an interrupt when its overflow bit was set, and in the interrupt service routine (ISR) reset the timer countdown to the desired period minus a hefty fudge to accommodate for the
        time the instructions running in the ISR would take to execute. The actual RS232 implementation is a simple state machine keeping track of sending the start bit, 8 data bits, and the final stop bit, plus some
        additional code dealing with a FIFO buffer to keep the pipeline active as long as possible. MPLAB IDE 8's simulator and stopwatch feature came in handy for determining the timer fudge value.</p>

        <p><strong>2013-12-13:</strong> Since I suck at all things mechanical, I'm delegating the aluminum chassis drilling work to my brother who is much more skilled in such things than I am. In preparation for that, I
        modified the Win32 test harness to show drilling coordinates (in inches currently) when the space bar is hit. All X,Y coordinates are relative to the origin at the top-left. Here's what that looks like:</p>
