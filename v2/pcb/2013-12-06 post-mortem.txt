
A list of PCB design mistakes and construction mistakes made, noticed after PCBs arrived and components soldered on:

  * ICD 5-pin header too close to MIDI socket; PICkit 3 is too fat to fit without adapter cable
  * used 30 gauge wire to relocate ICD header; should've used thicker gauge
  * Eagle package used for ceramic capacitors has spacing too wide; 100mil shorter is better, don't have to bend leads that way
  * didn't leave enough clearance around 16-pin pin headers; socket cables have extra width
  * NPN transistor pins are not angled; should've used a different Eagle package with coplanar pins
  * could have used resistor arrays for LEDs
