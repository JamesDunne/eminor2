
A list of PCB design mistakes and construction mistakes made, noticed after PCBs arrived and components soldered on:

Construction flaws:
  * ICD 5-pin header too close to MIDI socket; PICkit 3 is too fat to fit without adapter cable
  * used 30 gauge wire to relocate ICD header; should've used thicker gauge
  * Eagle package used for ceramic capacitors has spacing too wide; 100mil shorter is better, don't have to bend leads that way
  * didn't leave enough clearance around 16-pin pin headers; socket cables have extra width
  * NPN transistor pins are not angled; should've used a different Eagle package with coplanar pins

Should have:
  * planned top silk screen better; some labels can be moved to better locations
  * add silk screen to bottom of PCB
  * fewer prototyping vias
  * redesigned mux pin mappings to be linear
  * maybe should have used 220 ohm resistor arrays for LEDs
